# Az-Moga-Tuk-I-Sega

Information about the game for the competition AzMogaTukISega

Our project is created using the old DOM Manipulation way using JavaScript. The routing is managed by the page.js library. The single player is made in way which MR Robot makes the next move on the square which will bring him more points so he has bigger chance to win the game. For saving the best scores in the single player mode and the last games in multiplayer mode we are using Firebase realtime-database.


How to start the project:
1. Open the file with VS Code 
2. Use live-server
3. Enjoy the game
